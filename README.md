Contents

instagram_data_analysis.py: The Python script that performs data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks on the Instagram data.
Data Analysis and Visualization

The script generates histograms to visualize the distribution of impressions from different sources, such as home, hashtags, explore, and other.
Word clouds are created from the caption and hashtags data, showcasing the most frequently occurring words in the text data.
Scatter plots are utilized to explore relationships between total impressions and other variables, including likes, comments, and shares.
Correlation analysis is performed to understand potential relationships between different numeric columns in the data.
Machine Learning

A Passive Aggressive Regressor model from the scikit-learn library is trained to predict impressions based on likes, saves, comments, shares, profile visits, and follows.
The script calculates the R-squared score of the model to evaluate its performance on the testing data.
An example prediction is demonstrated using the trained model.
Usage
